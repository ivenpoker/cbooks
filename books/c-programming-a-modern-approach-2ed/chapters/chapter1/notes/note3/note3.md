C has had a huge influence on modern-day programming languages, many of which borrow heavily from it.
Of the many C-based languages, several are especially prominent.

* **C++** includes all the features of C, but adds classes and other features to support 
  object-oriented programming. 
* **Java** is based on C++ and therefore inherits many C features.
* **C#** is a more recent language derived form C++ and Java.
* **Perl** was originally a fairly simple scripting language; over time it has grown and 
  adopted many of the features of C.
