        Building C skills by learning with w3resource platform. C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming 
        language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system 
        prevents many unintended operations. C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell 
        Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used 
        programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing 
        computer architectures and operating systems.
