A perimeter is a path that surrounds a two-dimensional shape. The word comes from the Greek peri (around) and meter 
(measure). The perimeter can be used to calculate the length of fence required to surround a yard or garden. For 
rectangles or kites which have only two different side lengths, say x and y, the perimeter is equal to 2x + 2y.

The area of a two-dimensional figure describes the amount of surface the shape covers. You measure area in square units
of a fixed size, square units of measure are square inches, square centimeters, or square miles etc. The formula for
the area of a rectangle uses multiplication: _length â€¢ width = area_.  A rectangle with four sides of equal length is a 
square.
